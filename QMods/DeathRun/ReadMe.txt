:: SETTINGS DETAILS ::

(In all cases "Easy" setting disables that part of the mod and makes it like vanilla Subnautica)

1. DAMAGE TAKEN - slight variance by source of damage, but w/in these bounds.
	a. "No Way" - Damage x2 to x3. Respawn health 10%
	b. "Death Run" - Damage x1.5 to x2. Respawn health 25%
	c. "Hard" - Damage x1.25 to x1.5.  Respawn health 50%
	d. "Love Taps" - Damage x1.10 to x1.25.  Respawn health 75%

2. SURFACE AIR - whether surface air is breathable
    a. "Death Run" - never breathable until "Integrated Filter Chip" built - enabled at time of Aurora repair.
	b. "Hard" - not breathable while Aurora radiation is active (breathable before and after)

3. RADIATION - radiation even when not near Aurora
    a. "Worse than Death Run" - max radiation extends to 200m below surface
	b. "Death Run" - max radiation extends to 60m below surface
	c. "Hard" - max radiation extends to 30m below surface

4. NITROGEN and THE BENDS
	a. "Death Run" - Nitrogen & The Bends fairly strict (penalizes fast ascents, possibility of damage)
	b. "Hard" - Less strict version (slower penalties, less damage, no N2 accumulation while "inside")

5. PERSONAL DIVING DEPTH - you have a "crush depth" just like your vehicles. 
	a. "Death Run" - Basic crush depth 200m. Radiation Suit to 500m. Reinforced Dive Suit up to 800m. Need to upgrade it to Mark2 and Mark3 for 1300m and unlimited levels, respectively.  An upgrade of Stillsuit is also available.
	b. "Hard" - Same as above, except Reinforced Dive Suit has unlimited depth, so no need to upgrade it.

6. EXPLOSION DEPTH
	a. "Death Run" - Aurora explosion varies w/ depth and reaches about 100m deep. 50% reduced if "inside".
	b. "Hard" - Aurora explosion varies w/ depth and reaches about 50m deep. 50% reduced if "inside".

7. EXPLOSION TIME
	a. Random - the random range is the same as the vanilla game (I believe between just over 45 minutes to about 75 minutes)
	b. Short - Explosion 45 minutes after game start
	c. Medium - Explosion 60 minutes after game start
	d. Long - Explosion 90 minutes after game start

8. POWER COSTS
	a. Death Run - most power costs are x3, but x5 while "in radiation". (So 15 per fabrication, or 25 in radiation). Recharge 1/6 speed, or 1/10 speed in radiation.
	b. Hard - most power costs are x2, but x3 while "in radiation". (So 10 per fabrication, 25 in radiation). Recharge 1/3 speed, or 1/5 in radiation.

9. BATTERY COSTS - also no tools "come with" batteries while any of these settings active
	a. Worse than Death Run - basic copper batteries only hold 25 power.
	b. Death Run - basic copper batteries hold 50 power. Not rechargeable, but can be "recycled" (3 dead batteries into 2 copper). Must build Lithium batteries for rechargeable: Lithium + Salt + Diamond + Rubber
	c. Hard - same as above except Copper batteries hold 75 power and Lithium batteries only cost Lithium + Salt.

10. POWER TO EXIT VEHICLES
    a. Worse than Death Run - power drain to exit away from Moon Pool is Depth / 2.5 for Seamoth. Half for Prawn. Halved for every Nano-Decompression upgrade module.
	b. Death Run - power drain to exit away from Moon Pool is Depth / 10 for Seamoth. Half for Prawn. Halved for every Nano-Decompression upgrade module.
	c. Hard - power drain to exit away from Moon Pool is Depth / 20 for Seamoth. Half for Prawn. Halved for every Nano-Decompression upgrade module.

11. VEHICLE COSTS - generally designed to require player to reach deeper depths or more locations before acquiring vehicles
	a. "No Vehicles Challenge!" - Seamoth/Prawn/Cyclops can't be built until Hatching Enzymes produced. Seaglide is same as DeathRun
	b. "Death Run" - the two options vary only the Seamoth recipe
		Seaglide - 2xLubricant, 1xCopperWire, 2xLead, 2xGold
		Seamoth (exotic costs) - Plasteel + 2xEnameled + 2xLubricant + 4xLead + one of each Hatching Enzyme ingredient except the super-rare one.
		Seamoth (alternative costs) - Plasteel + 2xEnameled + 2xLubricant + 4xLead + 3xHydrochloricAcid + Aerogel
		Prawn - 2xPlasteel + 2xAerogel + 2xEnameled + 2xDiamond + 3xSulfur + 3xNickel + 3xLubricant
		Cyclops - 3xPlasteel + 3xEnameled + 3xNickel + AdvancedWiringKit + 6xUraninite + 4xLubricant
		(Various depth module costs also increase)
	c. "Hard"
		Seaglide - 2xLubricant, 1xCopperWire, 1xLead, 1xGold
		Seamoth - Plasteel + 2xEnameled + 3xLubricant + 4xLead
		Prawn - 2xPlasteel + 2xAerogel + Enameled + Diamond + Sulfurx2 + Nickelx2 + Lubricantx2
		Cyclops - 3xPlasteel + 3xEnameled + 4xLubricant + AdvancedWiringKit + 2xUraninite + 2xNickel
		(Depth module costs remain as in basic game)

12. HABITAT BUILDER - now misnamed, really controls several recipes for important "one-time-build" tools, buildings, and weapons. Requires exciting out-of-my-comfort-zone adventures! :)
	a. Death Run
		Habitat Builder - 2xComputerChip, 2xWiringKit, 2xLithium, 1xMagnetite
		Stasis Rifle - ComputerChip, 4xMagnetite, 2xUraninite, Benzene
		Propulsion Cannon - WiringKit, 2xMagnetite, 2xLead

14. CREATURE AGGRESSION
        a. Worse than DeathRun (like Death Run except creatures can see you through terrain)
        b. Death Run
            Creatures must have "line-of-sight" to you (no blocking terrain), but will notice you even if you're behind them (i.e. out of field-of-view of their eyes)
            You are always at least "twice as attractive" a target when picking among multiple targets
            After 20 minutes, creatures can notice you from 2x the distance, and you are now "four times as attractive"
            After 40 minutes, creatures can notice you from 3x the distance, and you are now "infinitely attractive"
        c. Hard
            Creatures must be able to see you within their field-of-view from their eyes
            After 20 minutes, you are "twice as attractive" to creatures, and creatures can see you from a bit further (2x for small creatures, 1.25x for big creatures)
            After 40 minutes, you are "3x as attractive" to creatures, but aggro range does not increase

15. START LOCATION
        a. BASIC GAME - Life Pod starts exactly as in regular Subnautica (floats on surface, at a location determined randomly by the basic game)
        b. RANDOM - Life Pod sinks to the bottom at a specially chosen random location. It will also be at a funny angle until you repair its secondary systems.
        c. Special Locations - you can choose from among the specific sink-to-the-bottom locations - in this case everything will function the same as B apart from picking your specific start point

16. RADIATION FX IF IMMUNE
        a. Aurora as Chernobyl - even while wearing a radiation suit, the green radiation FX will increase as you approach the Aurora and will be drastically increased inside the Aurora (until you repair it). The difficulty of seeing while reaching and repairing the reactor is the challenge.
        b. Mild Reminder - even while wearing a radiation suit, a mild green radiation FX will appear on the screen as a reminder, but it will not ramp up as you enter the Aurora

17. FILTER PUMP
        a. Challenge - not NEAR Aurora -- the filter pump will not work for breathing when within the Aurora's normal radiation radius (does not include the extra permanent depth-based radiation)
        b. Challenge - not INSIDE Aurora -- the filter pump will not work for breathing while you are inside the Aurora (until you repair the radiation leaks)
        c. Works Anywhere - Filter pump works like normal, and can filter air for you even inside the irradiated Aurora

18. NONVIOLENT CHALLENGE - the knife now does 0 damage. You can still theoretically kill things by crashing your vehicle into them, hurling them into walls, etc.

19. FARMING CHALLENGE - plants grow either 1/6 or 1/3 speed, so it's harder to "farm" them

20. FOOD CHALLENGE
        a. Vegetarian Challenge - you can't eat fish, only plants & nutrient blocks
        b. Vegan Challenge - you can only eat plants, no nutrient blocks
        c. Radical Pescatarian Challenge - you can only eat fish, no plants or nutrient blocks
