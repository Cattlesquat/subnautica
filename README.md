# SubnauticaMods
These are mods that Seraphim has developed or is developing for Subnautica. Two have been released so far.

-EnzymeChargedBattery was developed as a clone of PrimeSonic's MidGameBattery to foster understanding of the mod process.

-NoObservatoryMusic really just nullifies the observatory biome ENTIRELY because of undesired effects

-BiomeHUDIndicator is currently a WIP. When done, it will display the current biome in a way consistent with the rest of the player HUD.

-NitrogenMod is planned to reintroduce Nitrogren to the game, and also add HUD indicators for it.

-RotateMoonpool is an experiment in figuring out how to enable Moonpool rotation on habitats.
